# Compass
Compass is designed to enable interaction with elements generated by D3 or AngularJS in a Selenium environment.

Currently Compass is still under early development and is only implemented in Java.

##Angular
Part of Compass is inspired by the Protractor end-to-end framework found at https://github.com/angular/protractor
Compass takes some of Protractor's locator functions and ports them to Java.

##D3
Compass adds support for interacting with objects generated by D3 using Selenium. Currently Selenium has a hard time interacting with web elements that are inside of an SVG element in certain browsers. Compass circumvents this problem by calling the onclick() methods for such elements directly.

Compass also adds several new locators designed specifically for particular layouts supported by D3.
