# Compass
Compass is designed to enable interaction with elements generated by D3 or AngularJS in a Selenium environment.

Currently Compass is still under early development and is only implemented in Java.

##Angular
Compass is inspired by the Protractor end-to-end framework found at https://github.com/angular/protractor
Compass takes some of Protractor's locator functions and ports them to Java.
